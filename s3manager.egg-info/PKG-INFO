        ## Getting Started
        
        Steps to get started:-
        1. pip install s3manager
        
        Steps to Use:-
        
        
        ```
        from s3manager import S3manager
        s3_object_manager = S3manager(bucket_name="bucketname", access_key=<access_key>, access_secret=<access_secret>)
        ```
        To upload file to s3
        ```
        s3_object_manager.upload_file(file_name=<file_name>, filepath=<filepath>, acl='public-read')
        ```
